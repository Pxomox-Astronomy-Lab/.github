**Astronomical research computing platform designed as a skill multiplier laboratory**

## üî≠ Mission

The Proxmox-Astronomy-Lab organization develops enterprise-grade astronomical research computing infrastructure that creates cascading skill development across systems engineering, DevOps, security, automation, machine learning, and AI. Every infrastructure decision drives research capability, which informs better automation, which teaches deeper technical skills - creating an upward spiral of capability that makes us better researchers, engineers, and scientists.

Our work focuses on computational analysis of high-quality public astronomical datasets, positioning for upcoming surveys like Vera Rubin Observatory while building reproducible workflows that demonstrate how modern enterprise practices enable rather than hinder scientific research.

## üåü Open Science & Open IT Philosophy

We practice radical transparency in both research and infrastructure development. Every workflow, decision, failure, and success is documented with the intent that our entire approach - from lab architecture to research pipelines - is completely reproducible. This Open Science/Open IT philosophy ensures that:

- **Research methodologies** are fully documented and repeatable
- **Infrastructure configurations** are version-controlled and automated
- **Security implementations** demonstrate enterprise practices in research environments
- **Learning processes** are captured and shared for community benefit

## üèóÔ∏è Platform Architecture

Our production research platform runs on a 7-node Proxmox cluster (144 cores, 700GB RAM) built from MS-A1 small form factor workstations that fit on a closet shelf while delivering enterprise-grade computational capability. The platform implements:

- **Hybrid Kubernetes + VM Architecture**: RKE2 orchestration with strategic static VMs for databases and persistent services
- **Enterprise Security Baseline**: CIS Controls implementation as both security research and operational requirement
- **Secure Remote Access**: Entra E5 hybrid identity with Cloudflare ZTNA for staff and external researcher collaboration
- **Open Source Toolchain**: GitOps automation, container orchestration, and scientific computing workflows

This architecture enables secure, scalable astronomical research while serving as a learning laboratory for modern infrastructure practices.

## üî¨ Current Research & Development

We are actively running research projects on production infrastructure while continuing platform expansion:

### Active Research Projects

**DESI Cosmic Void Analysis** - Our flagship research project focuses on analyzing the large-scale structure of the universe using DESI Data Release 1, specifically examining galaxy populations within cosmic voids. This work involves processing 30GB+ PostgreSQL datasets containing spectroscopic observations of void galaxies, implementing statistical analysis pipelines to understand how galaxy properties correlate with void environments, and developing visualization tools for three-dimensional void mapping. The project demonstrates enterprise-scale data management while contributing to our understanding of structure formation in the universe.

**DESI AGN Outflow Studies** - This project investigates active galactic nucleus outflows through semi-automated spectral fitting techniques combined with Cloudy photoionization modeling. We're developing automated pipelines that can identify and characterize AGN-driven outflows in massive spectroscopic datasets, using machine learning to classify spectral features and systematic modeling to understand the physical conditions of outflowing material. The work advances both astronomical understanding of galaxy evolution and demonstrates sophisticated data processing workflows on our enterprise infrastructure.

**DESI Anomalous Quasar Detection** - Leveraging machine learning for large-scale anomaly detection across millions of quasar spectra in the DESI survey. This project implements distributed computing frameworks using Ray clusters on our Kubernetes infrastructure to process massive datasets, develop 1D convolutional variational autoencoders for spectral analysis, and identify statistically unusual quasars that may represent new physics or rare astrophysical phenomena. The project showcases both AI/ML capabilities and the power of modern infrastructure for scientific discovery.
